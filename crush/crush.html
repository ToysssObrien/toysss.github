  <p style="text-align: center;">
    Hey [Crush's Name],
  </p>
  <p>
    I just wanted to take a moment to let you know how much I appreciate you. From your smile to your laugh, you light up my day every time I see you. I hope this message finds you well and brings a smile to your face. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I'd love the chance to get to know you better and see where this could go. If you're interested, let's grab a coffee or a drink sometime soon. 
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: right;">
    Best regards,<br>
    [Your Name]
